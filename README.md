[How to play](#keybinds-to-play)

## Overview
The Arduino-Pong project is a Pong video game developed on Arduino as a final project for a course. The game integrates various concepts learned throughout the course, providing a comprehensive demonstration of the skills acquired.

## Project Requirements
The project was developed under the following requirements:

- The project integrates the concepts learned throughout the course.
- The project was developed individually or in groups of up to two members.
- The project includes bidirectional communication between Arduino and PC.
- The graphical interface on the PC was developed using Processing.
- The project involves reading sensors or actuating actuators from Arduino.
- The main operating states are indicated on Arduino using its LEDs.
- The operation of Arduino and Processing is programmed following the model of a state machine.
- A Class is created and used (either in Arduino or in Processing).
- Data is saved in files (either in Arduino or in Processing). This allows for the recovery of data to add new data without deleting previous data (append mode).
- Data is managed in memory (containers of objects such as Array, or arrays of structures or linked lists).

## Progress and Presentation
- Progress on the project was presented to teachers in each class.
- Once the project met the requirements, a presentation date was assigned.
- The project was versioned using Git and hosted in a public GitHub repository.
- An oral and in-person presentation of the work was made, with all group members present.
- The presentation included a discussion of the project and related topics.
- Teachers evaluated the members, with individual grades for each member.

## Documentation
- Each function in the source code is documented in its header.
- The work is versioned using Git and hosted in a public GitHub repository.
- The details of the delivery format will be uploaded to the practice room.
